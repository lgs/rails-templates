== Overview

A collection of modular rails templates you can even apply to your existing Rails application using rails:template rake task and supplying LOCATION environment variable : 

     rake rails:template LOCATION=/path/to/template 

or to quickly generate a new Rails project that uses various gems, plugins, and that even has a customized file layout.

     use it at your own risk, this code is for my personal learning/testing purposes.
